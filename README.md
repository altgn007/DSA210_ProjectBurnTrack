# BurnTrack: Running Insights with Apple Watch

## Description
**Sabanci University - Mehmet Ali Atag√ºn, 29481, DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Project.**  
This project aims to explore and analyze my daily running habits using data collected from the **Apple Watch Workout app**. By focusing on calories burned, distance covered, and time spent running, I plan to uncover trends and insights that can help improve my fitness routine.

## Motivation
Running is a core part of my daily routine, and I have always been curious about how my efforts translate into measurable fitness outcomes. With this project, I aim to:
- Understand trends in my calorie burn, running distance, and time spent.
- Leverage these insights to improve the consistency and effectiveness of my workouts.
- Develop a data-driven approach to monitor and enhance my physical performance.

---

## Tools
- **Apple Watch Workout App:** For collecting data during each running session.
- **Python:** For processing and analyzing the collected data.
- **Pandas & Matplotlib (Planned):** To structure the data and create visualizations.

---

## Data Source
The data for this project will be collected manually from the **Apple Watch Workout app**, which provides detailed metrics for each workout session. The dataset will include the following variables:
- **Date:** The date of the workout.
- **Distance (km):** The total distance covered during the run.
- **Duration (minutes):** The time spent running.
- **Calories Burned:** The estimated calories burned as tracked by the Apple Watch.

## Project Plan
1. **Data Collection:**
   - I will manually log my workout data from the Apple Watch Workout app after each run.
   - The data will be organized into a structured CSV file for analysis.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Clean and format the raw data for consistency.
   - Filter out incomplete or anomalous entries.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Compute summary statistics to identify patterns (e.g., average calories burned, total distance run).
   - Analyze trends over time, such as weekly or monthly calorie burn.

4. **Visualization (Planned):**
   - Create graphs to visualize calorie burn trends, distance vs. calories, and run duration trends.

5. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - Gain insights into my running habits and patterns.
   - Identify areas where I can improve consistency or efficiency in my runs.

## Notes
- This project is in its initial planning stage, and analysis will begin once sufficient data has been collected.
- Future improvements could include automating data collection directly from the Apple Health app or expanding the dataset with additional metrics like heart rate or elevation.
