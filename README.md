# BurnTrack: Running Insights with Apple Watch

## Project Description
Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project. **BurnTrack** is a personal data analysis project that explores running habits by providing insights into calories burned, distance covered, and time spent. The data was collected using the **Apple Watch Workout app**, making it easy to track and analyze daily fitness activities. This project uses exploratory data analysis and visualizations to identify trends and optimize fitness routines.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises personal running data logged manually from the **Apple Watch Workout app** after each run. Each workout session includes the following variables:
- **Date**: The date of the workout.
- **Distance (km)**: The total distance covered during the run.
- **Duration (minutes)**: The time spent running.
- **Calories Burned**: The estimated calories burned, as recorded by the Apple Watch.

The data is stored in a structured CSV format for further analysis.

## Methods
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Workout data was observed and recorded after each session using the Apple Watch Workout app.
   - The dataset was prepared for analysis by organizing it into a CSV file.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Performed summary statistics to examine average, maximum, and minimum values.
   - Identified trends in weekly and monthly calorie burn.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created line and bar charts to visualize the relationship between distance, time, and calories burned.
   - Highlighted patterns in consistency and variations in running habits.

4. **Future Work (Optional):**
   - Develop a predictive model to estimate calories burned based on distance and duration.

## Results
Key insights from the project:
- Identified days with the highest and lowest calorie burn.
- Observed correlations between running distance and calories burned.
- Gained a clearer understanding of weekly and monthly running trends.
