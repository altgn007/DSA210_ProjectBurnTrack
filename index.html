    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      These data show that as I started with <strong>2 km in the first week and increased by +1 km each week</strong> 
      , my weight loss accelerated week by week. By the final week, I observed a decrease from 
      <strong>78 kg to 75 kg</strong>. Therefore, the initial hypothesis of the project, <em>“Weekly distance increases accelerate the rate of weight loss”</em> 
      appears to be <strong>supported</strong> in light of these sample data.
    </p>

  <section class="data-extraction">
    <h2>How Did I Obtain Apple Fitness Data?</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Fitness</strong> app on the Apple Watch records my runs and other exercises in the <em>Apple Health</em> database. There are several ways to manually export these data in CSV or XML format. Here are the steps I followed:
    </p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>
        I opened the <strong>Health</strong> app on my <strong>iPhone</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I went to the profile tab of the Health app (the profile in the top right or the side menu) and selected <em>"Export Health Data"</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        This process gave me an archive file named <code>export.zip</code>. Inside this archive, there was a large XML file in <code>export.xml</code> format containing <em>all my health data</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Converting XML to CSV:</strong>
        For this process, you can use free online converter tools or Python libraries (e.g., <code>xml.etree</code> or <code>pandas</code>). The goal is to filter records labeled as <em>Running</em> or <em>Fitness</em> and extract fields such as date, distance, calories, etc., into <code>.csv</code> format.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the CSV file I obtained, I extracted columns such as <strong>date</strong>, <strong>distance</strong>, <strong>duration</strong>, and <strong>calories burned</strong>, as well as other fields like <em>average heart rate</em>, <em>elevation gain</em>, etc., if available.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, I selected the records (from November 15 to December 29) that I wanted to include in my project and transferred them to the table.
      </li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>
      Thus, I converted the data from the <strong>Apple Fitness</strong> app into <code>.csv</code> format using a <em>manual or semi-automatic</em> method and transformed it into the table used in my project.
    </p>
  
    <p class="note">
      Note: These steps may vary slightly depending on the <strong>iOS and Apple Watch</strong> versions. Some third-party apps (e.g., <em>RunGap</em>, <em>HealthFit</em>, etc.) can also directly export data as CSV.
    </p>

  <section class="future-work">
    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <ul> 
      <li>
        Extend the data collection period (e.g., 3 months, 6 months) to examine long-term weight change trends.
      </li> 
      <li>
        Include additional variables (e.g., calorie intake tracking, heart rate, sleep duration, etc.).
      </li> 
      <li>
        Use weekly average weight data instead of daily weigh-ins to smooth fluctuations.
      </li> 
      <li>
        Generalize this hypothesis with larger data sets (from different participants).
      </li>
